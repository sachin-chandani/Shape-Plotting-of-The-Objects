# Shape-Plotting-of-The-Objects
Developed a prototype of Shape Detecting System which can plot 3 dimensional image of object kept in front of it. The majors of this project were embedded C, micro-controllers and system optimization techniques.

#Files' Details

Shape_Detection_PPT_1.pdf and Shape_Detection_PPT_2.pdf are the presentation files.

EW2_Report_XXX_XXX.pdf contains the details of the project including caliberation of sensors and hardware design.

cal_LED.ino has Arduino UNO code to caliberate individual LEDs as per room light interference and providing a mean value.
